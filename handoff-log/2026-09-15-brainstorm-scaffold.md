# 2026-09-15 — brainstorm + scaffold

- Surveyed the reference implementation (`z-Git\armorpaint-mcp`) in depth via
  a research subagent: patch-and-rebuild architecture, ~40-struct native
  coupling, silent-no-op patch fragility, zero tests, Windows unverified.
- Read ArmorPaint's own source directly and found it already ships native
  CLI automation (`--background`, `--export-*`, `--script`, `--api`) and a
  real scripting engine (`minic`, `minic_api_list.h`) — the reference's core
  "no plugin SDK exists" premise doesn't hold for the batch-mode scope.
- Ran `superpowers:brainstorming` (architectural path) to converge on scope
  and architecture; wrote and got approval on the design spec.
- Started `project-setup` to scaffold git/docs/build-stamp/package skeleton.
