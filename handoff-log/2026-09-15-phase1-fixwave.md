# 2026-09-15 — final whole-branch review fix wave

- Fixed the review's Critical finding: `runner.py` decided success by
  diffing output-directory filenames, but ArmorPaint overwrites rather than
  creating uniquely-named files — so a re-export reported a false failure
  and a second preset into the same directory reported a partial file list
  as `ok=True`. Completion is now derived from the preset's own JSON
  definition (`data/export_presets/<preset>.json`) and each expected file
  must be (re)written by this run.
- Fixed six Important findings: config validation in `reexport_project`
  (`_ensure_ready`, not bare `load_config`), HANDOFF stating the
  `--background` fact backwards, no MCP-registration coverage (test +
  smoke probe), `pytest -q` silently running the integration test,
  `try/finally` around the poll loop so the GUI process can't be leaked,
  and `AP_OUTPUT_DIR` documented as live when nothing reads it.
- Scoped re-review: all findings addressed, no new Critical/Important
  breakage. Three items parked (not load-bearing): a stale docstring in
  `tests/test_reexport_integration.py` still naming the pre-`addopts`
  invocation; a theoretical uncaught `AttributeError` in `runner.py` if a
  preset JSON's `textures` entries were ever malformed (unreachable against
  every real preset in this install); and a narrow case where a config
  failure's actionable message gets masked by the MCP SDK's generic error
  wrapping (matches this project's pre-existing `main()` convention, not a
  regression).
- Merged `phase1-reexport-project` into `main` (fast-forward,
  `0447c03..46f6b37`), re-verified green, deleted the branch locally and on
  origin.
