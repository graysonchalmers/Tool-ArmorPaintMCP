# 2026-09-15 — Phase 1 (`reexport_project`) subagent-driven execution

- Executed the 8-task Phase 1 plan on feature branch
  `phase1-reexport-project` (controller decision: not on `main`, for
  safety, made before Task 1).
- Built `paths.py` (sandboxing), `runner.py` (subprocess runner for native
  `--export-textures`, deliberately **without** `--background`), and the
  `reexport_project` MCP tool.
- Added a real binary `.arm` fixture, unit tests, and one passing
  integration test run against real ArmorPaint on this machine.
- Added a docs gallery with two real (if visually flat/deliberately-blank
  fixture) example output images and an honest caption.
- Task 8 final verification sweep all green (unit, integration, smoke,
  `--check`); pushed `phase1-reexport-project` to origin.
